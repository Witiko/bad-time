00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,798
(Kazooing)

2
00:00:01,843 --> 00:00:02,272
(Girl Voice) Baby

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,586
(Suddenly, wild brass appears)

4
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:06,406
(Girl Voice) Baby Baby

5
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,290
(Kazooing intensifies to the point
we may not be able to contain it)

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,304
(But why contain it?)
(Girl Voice) Baby × 10

7
00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:20,445
(Funky stuff)

8
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:22,810
(Funky stuff)
Holy sh*t!

9
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:35,580
(Funky stuff)

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,194
I thought told y'all to sit down or get down

11
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:38,286
I'm about'a hit ground

12
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:40,171
When I'm in the box, my hits way out of this bounds

13
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,319
Nobody's topping me
(You know it, damn right)

14
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,249
Most of y'alls loving me
(Doing it all night)

15
00:00:44,249 --> 00:00:46,234
Keeping my friends close,
and my foes closer

16
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,277
Things getting messy,
but I never lift the nose up

17
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:50,237
As I get older
See things slower

18
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:52,344
My enemies looking like kids,
and I'm the grown up
(Forget it!)

19
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,099
I'm the next masterpiece made

20
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,275
A new generation team,
a wicked beast "Ace"

21
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:57,232
But I'm the mister nice guy

22
00:00:57,232 --> 00:00:58,404
See? I'm a wise guy

23
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,347
Not a mafioso, but I hustle like Mike

24
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:02,074
Lay low if you're feelin' me

25
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:04,118
I take these beats, freaks go crazy with me

26
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:05,461
So put 'em up in this base with me

27
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:08,428
So shake with the man, L to the J's, now follow me

28
00:01:08,428 --> 00:01:23,425
(You feel like you are going to have a Kazoo time)

29
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,029
I thought told y'all to sit down or get down

30
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,121
I'm about'a hit ground

31
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:28,006
When I'm in the box, my hits way out of this bounds

32
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,154
Nobody's topping me
(You know it, damn right)

33
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:32,084
Most of y'alls loving me
(Doing it all night)

34
00:01:32,084 --> 00:01:34,069
Keeping my friends close,
and my foes closer

35
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,112
Things getting messy,
but I never lift the nose up

36
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,072
As I get older
See things slower

37
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:40,179
My enemies looking like kids,
and I'm the grown up
(Forget it!)

38
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:44,293
(... let the funk pile up
in the streets!)
